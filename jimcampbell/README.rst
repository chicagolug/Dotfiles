Jim's Dotfiles
==============

Here you'll find dotfiles for these programs:

* vim (which I use most often)
* emacs (which I use in a pinch because its great NXML-Mode)
* ssh (sample config)

In my setup I actually store my dotfiles in a ~/Public/dotfiles directory, and
have symlinks to them in my home directory. This allows me to keep them under
revision control.

You may want to use these if you do XML stuff. If you don't do XML stuff,
you'll probably want other people's dotfiles.
